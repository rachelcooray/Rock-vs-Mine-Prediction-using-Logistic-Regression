# Sonar Rock vs Mine Prediction Project
This repository contains a machine learning project for classifying objects as rocks or mines based on sonar data using Logistic Regression.

## Overview

The objective of this project is to build a predictive model that can classify objects as either rocks or mines based on sonar data. The dataset contains 60 features corresponding to sonar signal attributes and a label (R for Rock, M for Mine).

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Sonar dataset. It can be found in the sonar data.csv file.
